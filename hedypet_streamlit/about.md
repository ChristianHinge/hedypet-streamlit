# About hedyPET

**He**althy **Dy**namic **PET** (hedyPET) is a multimodal whole-body PET/CT/MRI dataset of 100 healthy controls stratified on age and sex. Listmode and nifti files of 80 participants are shared in Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDs) format with the goal of increasing reproducibility and advancing research in the healthy PET connectome, multimodal learning, image reconstruction, attenuation correction, glucose kinetics, and image registration. The remaining 20 participants is held as a test-set for an upcoming medical imaging challenge and will be released at a later date. 

All data was acquired at the Department of Clinical Physiology and Nuclear Medicine, Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet.

## How to acquire the data

> Static, dynamic and Patlak PET readouts of organs and brain regions can be downloaded immediately from the official github repository (https://github.com/depict-rh/hedyPET) or be explored interactively on this web-page. 

The hedyPET dataset is hosted on the EU-centric [Public nEUro](https://datacatalog.publicneuro.eu/manage/register) data repository. To acquire the dataset, please first [register here](https://datacatalog.publicneuro.eu/manage/register), and then sign the hedyPET [data user agreement (DUA)](https://datacatalog.publicneuro.eu/dataset/PN000001%20OpenNeuroPET%20Phantoms/V1). Once the DUA has been recieved, you can download the dataset from the [Public nEUro data catalog](https://datacatalog.publicneuro.eu/dataset/PN000001%20OpenNeuroPET%20Phantoms/V1)

Three hedyPET BIDs datasets are available:
- **hedyPET static (129GB)** contains CT, MRI, static PET reconstructions, and anatomical segmentations
- **hedyPET dynamic (308GB)** contains dynamic PET reconstructions
- **hedyPET source (2.6TB)** contains PET listmode data and CT DICOM for attenuation correction
